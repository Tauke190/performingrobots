## Physical Description:

Tall, frail with age but sharp eyes
His face has a slight greenish hue, a result of a long-ago chemical accident that occurred during a failed experiment. The accident left visible green stains on his skin, adding to his eerie and mysterious demeanor.
Wears thick glasses, often carrying a small notebook for chemical observations
Always dressed in a faded lab coat, even outside the lab, as a badge of his scientific authority

## Backstory:

A brilliant scientist in his prime, Mr. Green has worked in the field of chemistry for over 40 years. He was once regarded as a pioneer in innovative chemical solutions, earning many accolades for his contributions.
Known for his obsession with pushing scientific boundaries, Mr. Green became more eccentric with age, disregarding standard safety protocols in his quest for breakthrough discoveries. This led to the infamous lab mishap that turned his skin green.
Despite his intellect, he developed a reputation for cutting corners and ignoring ethics in the workplace, especially when it came to quality assurance of products. He believed in “results over regulations.”
Relationship with the Victim:

Mr. Green worked for the victim’s company for several decades, leading the Research and Development (R&D) team. He had a strong influence over the scientific decisions of the company, but his methods became more questionable over time.
The victim (CEO or owner of the company) recently clashed with Mr. Green over his unethical practices. His most recent project was released without sufficient quality assurance, leading to customer complaints and a potential lawsuit.
As a result, the victim publicly demoted Mr. Green, stripping him of much of his influence within the company and placing him under the supervision of a younger, more cautious scientist, humiliating him.
Motive for Murder:

Mr. Green resented the demotion and felt personally insulted. He believed the victim had no appreciation for his years of dedication and contribution to the company.
He felt his life’s work was at stake, especially since the demotion threatened his reputation in the scientific community. The loss of control over his research fueled his anger and desire for revenge.
His fragile ego and obsession with control led him to plot against the victim, believing that without the victim in the picture, he could regain his former glory.

## Personality:

Highly intelligent but morally ambiguous
Driven by a desire for recognition and power, often at the cost of ethical considerations
Paranoid and vindictive after his demotion, harboring resentment toward those who question his methods

## Behavior During Investigation:

Acts aloof and detached, often responding to questions with overly scientific jargon to confuse the investigators.
Downplays his demotion, claiming that it was a misunderstanding and that he and the victim had resolved the issue amicably.
Suggests that other employees might have been jealous of his position in the company and could be responsible.
Displays a subtle, passive-aggressive attitude toward anyone questioning his integrity, hinting that they “don’t understand the brilliance” of his work.
